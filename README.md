# Mastermind

This a an implementation of the popular game MasterMind written entirely in Java. It is written with MVC concepts in mind.
There are two ways to run this application, one with the ptui and one with the gui. This is chosen by running either the MastermindGraphicalVC.java file or the MastermindTextVC.java. 
This was done as a class project. Part of this project was stubbed out by my professor but most of it was implemented by me.
